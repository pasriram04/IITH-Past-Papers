Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm :  <dt> <h4>\n","\n","Objective : Computing the N-point DFT of a signal requires $N^{2}$ complex multiplications and additions. However, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm optimizes the DFT algorithm by exploiting its redundant operations, resulting in an efficient computation of the N-point DFT algorithm. Specifically, the FFT algorithm computes the N-point DFT of the signal in $O(Nlog_{2}N)$ time complexity. While this reduction may seem trivial for small N, it is crucial for large values of N that arise in many practical applications. For example, a speech signal sampled at 8kHz would have 8000 samples per second, and computing the N-point DFT through the basic approach would require $N^{2} = 64$ million complex multiplications and additions. In contrast, the FFT algorithm only requires $Nlog_{2}N = 0.10$ million operations. This demonstrates the importance of the FFT algorithm in efficiently computing the DFT algorithm.

Simulation of Reverberation : </b> Reverberation is the persistence of sound in a particular space after the original sound is removed. Reverberation is created when a sound is produced in an enclosed space causing a large number of echoes to build up, and then slowly decay as the sound is absorbed by the walls and air. An echo can be thought of as a single and perceivable reflection of sound. The reverberation can be simulated by superposing several delayed and attenuated components of the source signal. Hence reverberated signal $x_{r}[n]$ can be expressed in terms of the source signal x[n] as </h6> </dt>\n","<dt> <h6> <center> $ x_{r}[n] = \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{M}a_{k}x[n-d_{k}] $ </center> </h6> </dt>\n","<dt> <h6> Where M is the number of reflected signals, $a_{k}$ and $d_{k}$ denotes the attenuation coefficient and delay of the $k^{th}$ reflected signal.  \n","\n","The impulse response of a room is a representation of how sound waves propagate and reflect within that room. It contains information about the room's acoustic characteristics, such as size, shape, and surface materials.
