A physical system may be defined as a physical device that performs a specific operation on an input signal. Most of the physical systems are inertial in nature, in the sense that they produce an output or response only when they are subjected to an external input or excitation. In consistent with this definition of the\n","system, a digital system is one that accepts a digital signal as input, and generates another digital signal as its output. </h4> </dt>\n","\n","<dt> <h4> For our purposes, it is convenient to broaden the definition of a system to include not only physical devices, but also software realizations of operations on a signal. In digital processing of signals on a digital computer, the operations performed on a signal consist of a series of mathematical operations as specified by a software program. In this case, the program represents an implementation of the system in software. Thus we have a system that is realized on a digital computer by means of a sequence of mathematical operations; that is we have digital signal processing realized in software. For example, a digital computer can be programmed to reduce noise and interference in the input signal.
